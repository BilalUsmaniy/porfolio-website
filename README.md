## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AWS S3 (for hosting and storage, as indicated by the `bucket-policy.txt`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/BilalUsmaniy/your-repository-name.git
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.
4. To modify themes, edit the corresponding CSS files (`default.css`, `blue.css`, `green.css`, `purple.css`).

## Theme Switching

The `script.js` file contains the logic for switching themes on the website. Themes are stored in the browser's local storage to remember the user's choice on their next visit.
